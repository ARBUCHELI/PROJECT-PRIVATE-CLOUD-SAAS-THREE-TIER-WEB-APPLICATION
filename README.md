# PROJECT-PRIVATE-CLOUD-SAAS-THREE-TIER-WEB-APPLICATION
Second Project of Udacity and Nutanix Hybrid Cloud Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Project Overview

## What are you going to build?

After your previous success demonstrating manual provisioning of VMs on a private cloud, the Vice President of Software Engineering has set your next project for on-premises
private cloud automation. In order to make the software developers productive, you are tasked to provide a rudimentary working model of The E-Commerce Companyâ€™s basic web site on
the private cloud in order to save on public cloud costs for test and development workloads.

## Project Steps

In order to complete the project, you will need to be able to:

* Design a blueprint to deploy and configure a three-tier web application with a load balancer, web server, and database VM hosted on the private cloud.
* Insure each VM in configured with the proper resources and tasks.
* Test the deployment works with a read and write to the database.
* Test web tier scaling: scale-in and scale-out actions changing the population by a count of 1.
* Allow an end user to make a database backup.}

## Project Requirements

After speaking to management in the software engineering release, database administrator, and Information Technology teams, you learn the business requirements are to provide a
self-service, three tier web application using The E-Commerce Company's standards.

The three tiers of the web application are:

* 1. a load balancer,
* 2. a web server,
* 3. and a database server.

Developers need a small deployment scenario, the ability to scale in and scale out the web tier, and to back up the database at any time.

* 1. The IT Manager states that all private cloud VMs must:
* Use the publicly available CentOS 8 image published on the CentOS website. The current image version's full URL is https://cloud.centos.org/centos/8/x86_64/images/CentOS-8-GenericCloud-8.2.2004-20200611.2.x86_64.qcow2 - please copy and paste the full URL when creating image configurations.
* Create and use the teccadmin account to configure the OS and install software. Please see the notes below regarding credentials that are specific to database VMs.
* All VM accounts require using SSH access and can be granted sudo privileges.

* 2. The IT Manager has already worked with the Software Release and Database Administration managers and negotiated the following developer requirements for the application environment:
* The load balancer VM will be a monolith for this project and use the latest HAProxy software included with the OS.
* The web tier will use Apache web server and use the latest version of httpd software included with the OS.
* The web tier VMs should be named wwwX, where X is a number. E.g: www0, www1, www2, etc.
* The deployment scenario should be named small and each VM should use the same resource sizes: 1 vCPU, 1 core, 1GB RAM
* The developer should be able to manually scale the web tier in and out by one VM at a time and the load balancer must use the updated web tier population.
* After deployment, a developer can make a database backup at any time.
* No VM resource parameters can be changed by the end user, except the Database VM memory.

* 3. The Database Administration Manager states that all database VMs must:
* Be configured as a monolith for this project and use the latest version of MySQL, currently version 8.x.
* Make appropriate use of the teccdba Calm credential to ensure security standards are applied throughout the application lifecycle. This approach must be applied to both 
deployment and post-deployment operations.
* Implement the ability to alter the root MySQL account at any time after the MySQL database has been deployed, using a password that is provided at run-time.
* Have access to a database named webapp that is deployed with a single table named tecc_dba_test.
* Be configured with a MySQL user named webapp_user that has all permissions on the webapp database and that is configured with the root password provided by the user.

* 4. The Software Release Manager requires the environment to pass a test to ensure the configuration works for a developer:
* The web app should be installed to the standard web docroot.
* Web app should use the database tecc_webuser user account and provided root password
* Web app should read and write to the tecc_dba_test database table
* The web tier should scale between 2 and 4 VMs.
* The test application and database schema source code are in:
* https://github.com/nutanixdev/udacity/tree/main/HybridCloudEngineer/course/2/project. Specifically:
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutanixdev/udacity/main/HybridCloudEngineer/course/2/project/tecc_dba_test.sql
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutanixdev/udacity/main/HybridCloudEngineer/course/2/project/tecc_dba_test.php

Please create, test, and publish the blueprint to satisfy these business requirements.

Be sure to save your blueprint to your Udacity workspace before leaving a Frame session!
